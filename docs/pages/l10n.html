<h1>Development - Localization</h1>

<h3>Internationalization</h3>
Localization (sometimes shortened to "l10n") is the process of adapting a product or service to a
particular language, culture, and desired local "look-and-feel." Ideally, a product or service is developed
so that localization is relatively easy to achieve - for example, by creating technical illustrations for
manuals in which the text can easily be changed to another language and allowing some expansion room for
this purpose. This enabling process is termed internationalization. An internationalized product or
service is therefore easier to localize. The process of first enabling a product to be localized and then
localizing it for different national audiences is sometimes known as globalization.

In localizing a product, in addition to idiomatic language translation, such details as time zones, money, national holidays, local color sensitivities, product or service names, gender roles, and geographic examples must all be considered. A successfully localized service or product is one that appears to have been developed within the local culture.

Language translation, which is a large part of localization, can sometimes be facilitated with automatic language translation. However, much additional work is usually needed.



<h4>Locale and Language</h4>
Locale is a set of parameters that defines the user's language, country and any special variant preferences
that the user wants to see in their user interface. It is usually identified by an ID consisting of a
language ID and a region ID. For example, the ID en_US stands for the locale of English and United States.
This feature released in a basic frame for some languages in <code>framework/i18n/</code> directory. Users
always may customize this feature to suit their needs.

<h4>Translation</h4>
This is the most needed feature of l10n and it including message translations. The former translates a text
message to the desired language.

A translation request consists of the object to be translated, the source language that the object is in,
and the target language that the object needs to be translated to. In ApPHP Framework, the source language
defaults to the application source language while the target language defaults to the application language.

<h3>Localization</h3>
<h4>Message Translation</h4>
Framework messages feature allow to implement the i10n (localization) concept. To release this feature the
framework stores message files for each language in a special directory, called <code>messages</code>. 
<br /><br />
These files may be created for application and they contain the array of localizable messages and constants.
You can modify them by translating the specific messages or create new files, specified for other category of
messages. In these files each array element represents the translation (value) of a message (key). The
default default name for application messages file is "app.php".
<br /><br />
They must be: 
<ul class="file-structure">
    <li class="folder-protected">
        <b>application/</b> <span class="description">application directory</span>
        <ul>
            <li class="folder-protected">
                <b>messages/</b> <span class="description">directory where placed all message files</span>
                <ul>
                    <li class="folder-protected">
                        <b>de</b> <span class="description">directory where message for German language</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="file">app.php <span class="description">application translation in German</span></li>
                            <li class="file">news.php <span class="description">news module translation in German</span></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li class="folder-protected">
                        <b>en</b> <span class="description">directory where message for English language</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="file">app.php <span class="description">application translation in English</span></li>
                            <li class="file">news.php <span class="description">news module translation in English</span></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li class="folder-protected">
                        <b>es</b> <span class="description">directory where message for Spanish language</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="file">app.php <span class="description">application translation in Spanish</span></li>
                            <li class="file">news.php <span class="description">news module translation in Spanish</span></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    ...
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>    
</ul>

Below the example of such message file:
<pre name="dlhl" class="php">return array (
    'Access' =>'Access',
    'Account Information' => 'Account Information',
    'Account Type' => 'Account Type',
    'Account Update Error Message' => 'An error occurred while updating the account! Please re-enter.',
    'Account Update Success Message' => 'Account {name} settings have been successfully updated.',
    'Accounts' => 'Accounts',
    'Actions' => 'Actions',
    'Active' => 'Active',
    ...
);</pre>
<br>

Usage example:
<pre name="dlhl" class="php">
echo A::t('app', 'Account Type'); 
echo A::t('app', 'Account Update Success Message', array('{name}'=>$accountName)); 
echo A::t('news', 'Add News'); 
</pre>
<br><br>


<h4>Modules Translation</h4>
It's recommended that each module will include it's own messages translation file. Such rule will provide
the independency of each module and will allow to copy the message file into existing languages.
<br /><br />
To make sure your message file will be copied into all existing languages in application, you have to
add following definition if module <code>info.xml</code> file:

<pre name="dlhl" class="php">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;install version="1.0" type="module"&gt;
    &lt;files&gt;
    ...
    &lt;messages installationPath="protected/messages/*"&gt;
        &lt;filename>testimonials.php&lt;/filename&gt;
    &lt;/messages&gt;
    ...
    &lt;/files&gt;
&lt;/install&gt;
</pre>
