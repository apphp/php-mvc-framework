<h1>Development - Dummy Application</h1>

<h3>General Description.</h3>
Each application's source files are stored in a separate directory.
<br><br>

For a quick start in development of a new application you may create an application template
(dummy application) as described below:
<br><br>

<ul>
    <li>Find <code>dummy_application.zip</code> file in the <code>docs/download/</code> directory or
        download it (see <a href="#download_dummy_application">button below</a>).
    </li>
    <li>Extract the dummy archive to the directory you need.</li>
    <li>Rename the <code>dummy_application/</code> directory into the name you preffer.</li>
</ul>

Define a path to your framework directory relatively to your application directory.
<pre name="dlhl" class="php">$apphp = dirname(__FILE__).'/../../framework/Apphp.php';</pre>

That's all! Now you may run your new application.
<br><br>

You may also download a code example for "dummy module".
<br>
Remember, that this only an example, you may need to add more features and procedures to
make your application works as expected.
