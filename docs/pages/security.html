<h3>Password Protection <a class="hashlink" href="#password-protection">¶</a></h3>

<div class="msg_important">
Passwords are like keys to your personal home online. You should do everything you can prevent people from
gaining access to your password. You can also further secure your accounts by using additional authentication methods. 
Read more about password protection on <a class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password">Wikipedia</a>.
</div>
<br>

ApPHP Framework provides you few ways to protect passwords for system users:
<ul>
	<li>encryption - allows to encrypt password using different encryption algorithms</li>
	<li>encryptAlgorithm - hashing algorithm used to encrypt password</li>
	<li>encryptSalt - password-level secret key ("salt") to be used with hashing algorithm</li>
	<li>hashKey - site-level secret key to be used with hashing algorithm</li>
</ul>
<br>

Here the example of password settings for your application defined in <code>config/main.php</code> file:
<pre name="dlhl" class="php">
// md5, sha1, sha256, whirlpool, etc
'password' => array(
    'encryption' => true,
    'encryptAlgorithm' => 'sha256',
    'encryptSalt' => true,
    'hashKey' => 'your unique hash key here...',    
),	
</pre>

<h3>Cross-Site Request Forgery Prevention <a class="hashlink" href="#cross-site-request-forgery">¶</a></h3>

<div class="msg_important">
CSRF (also known as a one-click attack or session riding) or XSRF is a type of malicious exploit of
a website whereby unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the website trusts. When a
user visits a malicious website, a hidden request is sent in his name to a remote server for
execution of a certain action (most often requests are sent to popular email services or social
networks, where user is most likely to be registered and authorized).

</div>
<br>

Generally Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack occurs when a malicious website causes your
web browser to execute a un-wanted action on a site you trust it. For example, such web site
has a special page that contains an image whose src attribute points to a Back-End My Account page: 
http://site.example/myAccount?changeEmail=yes&to=newEmail. 
If a user who has a login cookie for this site visits this malicous page, the action of changing
email will be executed. So, in other words... CSRF exploits the trust that a site has for a
particular user.
<br><br>

To prevent CSRF attacks, it is important to use the the rule where GET requests should only be
allowed to retrieve data rather than modify any data on the server. And for POST requests,
they should include some random value which can be recognized by the server to ensure the form
is submitted from and the result is sent back to the same origin.
<br><br>

ApPHP Framework implements a CSRF prevention scheme to help defeat POST-based attacks. It is based
on generating a random value in a session or cookie and comparing this value with the value
submitted via the POST request.

By default, the CSRF prevention is disabled. To enable it, configure the CHttpRequest framework
component as follows:
<pre name="dlhl" class="php">
private $_csrfValidation = true;
</pre>

or define in your application <code>config/main.php</code> file as follows:

<pre name="dlhl" class="php">
// Validations
// Define array of 'excluded' controllers, ex.: array('PaymentProviders', 'Checkout')
// Token type: 'session', 'cookie' or 'multipages'
'validation' => array(
    'csrf' => array('enable' => true, 'exclude' => array('PaymentProviders'), 'tokenType' => 'multipages'),
),
</pre>

AJAX. If you are utilizing JavaScript file in your application, then parameter
<code>APPHP_CSRF_TOKEN:token_value</code> must be added to all your POST requests.

It's automatically added to your FORM, when you use following in your code:
<pre name="dlhl" class="php">
CHtml::openForm('WebForms/submit', 'post', array('name'=>'form-contact'));
</pre>

For the cases when you work with controller that doesn't create token in form,
but processes it anyway, you may create token explicitly. Below the example
for such definition.
<pre name="dlhl" class="php">
public function insertAction()
{
    Website::prepareBackendAction('insert', 'news', 'news/manage');

    $cRequest = A::app()->getRequest();
    $cRequest->getCsrfTokenValue();
    ...
}
</pre>

<h3>Cross-Site Scripting Prevention <a class="hashlink" href="#cross-site-scripting">¶</a></h3>
<div class="msg_important">
Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in Web applications.
XSS enables attackers to inject client-side script into Web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site
scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same origin policy.

<h3>Brute-Force Attacks Prevention <a class="hashlink" href="#brute-force-attacks">¶</a></h3>

<div class="msg_important">
In cryptography, a brute-force attack, or exhaustive key search, is a cryptanalytic attack that can,
in theory, be used against any encrypted data (except for data encrypted in an information-theoretically
secure manner). Such an attack might be utilized when it is not possible to take advantage of other
weaknesses in an encryption system (if any exist) that would make the task easier. It consists of
systematically checking all possible keys or passwords until the correct one is found. In the worst
case, this would involve traversing the entire search space.

</div>
<br>

To prevent Brute-Force attacks, it is important to delay access to the for some time, if we see that
someone tries to login and search for username andf password. One simple technique that blocks access to
login page for defined time could make a search algorithm not effective.

<br><br>
By default, the Brute-Force prevention is disabled. To enable it, or define in your
application <code>config/main.php</code> file as follows:
<pre name="dlhl" class="php">
// Validation
'validation' => array(
    'bruteforce' => array('enable' => true, 'badLogins' => 5, 'redirectDelay' => 3),
),
</pre>
where 'badLogins' means a number of wrong logis after prevention is turned on and 'redirectDelay'
is the time is seconds, a while user is unable to acess the login page.
<br><br>
This feature must be released on application level, it is already embedded into

<h3>Session Cookies Modifying Prevention <a class="hashlink" href="#session-cookies-modifying">¶</a></h3>

To prevent session cookies modifying by user (for restoring old session, for example) you have to store session ID
in database (or in other custom storage).
You may find more information about this in <a href="index.php?page=session-custom-storage">Session Custom Storage</a> section.
