<h3>General Info <a class="hashlink" href="#general">¶</a></h3>
The "Controller" layer, as it defined in MVC representes two thinner layers in a framework: controllers and actions.
(The "Controller" layer also includes the main dispatcher script and the request routing system, though they are not directly
involved in application development.)
<br><br>

<b>Controller</b> is just a part of web application which is used to handle user requests. It is where an application
"determines", which blocks the resulting web page should consist of. In complex applications, for better source code readability,
it is reasonable to split the page generation logic into several parts. Each such part (responsible for generation of a single
informational block on a page) is called an action.
<br /><br />
Example of controllers:
<pre>UserController, AccountController, PageController, etc.</pre>

Ussually, Controller has more than one Action and may implement also some internal logic, that is not related to Actions.
Example of acceptable controller class:<br>

<pre name="dlhl" class="php">&lt;?php
class AccountController extends CController
{
    public function __construct()
	{
        parent::__construct();
    }
    
    // default action
    public function indexAction()
    {
        ...
    }

    // delete action
    public function deleteAction()
    {
        ...
    }

    // protected method (not action)
    protected function _protectedMethod()
    {
        ...
    }

    // private method (not action)
    private function _privateMethod()
    {
        ...
    }    
}
</pre>        
<br>

<b>Action</b> is a part of an application that responsible for generating a certain portion of the resulting HTML code. It may
be either entire web page or just a part of it. An action is always called from within a controller. When processing a user request,
a controller determines which actions must be called for generation of a specific web page and proceeds to calling them one
by one. Very often, when there is only one dynamically generated fragment on a page (i.e. the result of execution of a certain
action), a controller has only one task: to call the single available action. The framework offers the so-called default
controller which is executed, if no specific controller for a user request has been found, yet the action class matching
the routing system instructions exists.
<br /><br />
Example of actions:
<pre>Users/Edit, Pages/View, Pages/Edit, etc.</pre>
<br>

<h3>Implementation of the Action logic <a class="hashlink" href="#action_logic">¶</a></h3>

The general operating logic of most simple actions works according to the following scheme: retrieve data from the
model and pass them to the template engine to be displayed in the user browser.
<br><br>
Some types of HTTP requests may contain instructions for execution of actions which are not expected to generate any useful
content (web page). Execution of such actions may result in redirecting a user to another URL; e.g., after deletion of a
record or when data submitted via a web form have been saved on the server. In such cases the entire logic is implemented
in a controller and no individual actions are necessary.
<br><br>


<a name="action_parameters"></a>
<h3>Receiving parameters in Action <a class="hashlink" href="#action_parameters">¶</a></h3>

Since version 0.1.0, ApPHP Framework supports automatic action parameter binding. That means a controller action method
can define named parameters which values will be automatically populated from global <code>$_GET</code> array.
<br><br>
To demostrate how this works, let's assume that we need to create some action for <code>PagesController</code>.
The action requires two parameters:
<ul>
<li>category - an integer indicating the category ID;</li>
<li>language: a string indicating the language code.</li>
</ul>

We may use the following code for the purpose of retrieving the needed parameter values from <code>$_GET</code>:
<pre name="dlhl" class="php">&lt;?php
class PostsController extends CController
{
    public function actionCreate()
    {
        $category = '';
        if(isset($_GET['category'])){
            $category = (int)$_GET['category'];
        }
		
        $language = '';
        if(isset($_GET['language'])){
            $language = $_GET['language'];
        }
		
        // other code starts here ...
    }
}
</pre>

We can also use framework <code>Request</code> component to get the code more readable:
<pre name="dlhl" class="php">&lt;?php
class PostsController extends CController
{
    public function actionCreate()
    {
        $category = A::app()->getRequest()->getQuery('category');
        $language = A::app()->getRequest()->getQuery('language');
		
		// short format
		$category = A::app()->request()->post('category');
		$language = A::app()->request()->get('language');
		
        // other code starts here ...
    }
}
</pre>

Now using the action parameter feature, we can achieve this task in a more pleasant way:
<pre name="dlhl" class="php">&lt;?php
class PostsController extends CController
{
    public function actionCreate($category, $language='en')
    {
        $category = (int)$category;
		
        // other code starts here ...
    }
}
</pre>

Notice that we add two parameters to the action method actionCreate. The recommended way is to use the exactly
names for parameters in <code>$_GET</code>. The <code>$language</code> parameter takes a default value en in case
the request does not include such a parameter. Because $category does not have a default value, if the request
does not include a category parameter, so nothing will be passed to this action.

<h3>Rendering in Controllers - passing data to the View (template engine) <a class="hashlink" href="#rendering">¶</a></h3>
When generating the HTML code of the resulting web page, the view (template engine) processes the data
received from the action. Data should be passed to the template engine using the following syntax:

<pre name="dlhl" class="php">$this->_view->text = 'some text here...';
/* sample 1 - full syntax */
$this->_view->render('controller/view');
/* sample 2 - short syntax, missing controller means use current controller name */
$this->_view->render('view'); 
/* sample 3 partial rendering - for AJAX calls (2nd parameter $isPartial = true) */
$this->_view->render('view', true); 
/* sample 4 partial rendering with returned content - for some specific methods (2nd parameter $isPartial = true, 3rd parameter $return = true) */
$result = $this->_view->render('view', true, true);
</pre>


Example of an action class showing how data received from the model are passed to the view file:
<pre name="dlhl" class="php">
&lt;?php
class AccountController extends CController
{
    public function indexAction()
    {
        // create a model instance to retrieve data from the DB
        $model = new Accounts();
        
        // retrieve all records from DB
        $records = $model->fetchAll();
        
        // assign data to the view variables
        $this->_view->records = $records;
        $this->_view->title = 'Account Management';
        
        // pass prepared data to the view file
        $this->_view->render('accounts/index');
    }

    public function viewAction()
    {
        // example of working with active record
        $model = Accounts::model()->findByPk(10);
        $model->fieldA = 'new name';
        $model->fieldB = 'new type';    
        $model->save();

        // pass prepared data to the view file
        $this->_view->render('accounts/view');
    }
}    
</pre>

<a name="redirecting"></a>
<h3>Redirecting to another URL <a class="hashlink" href="#redirecting">¶</a></h3>
Browser redirection to a different URL is carried out in controller source code using the following syntax:
<pre name="dlhl" class="php">/* sample 1 */
$this->redirect('controller/action');
/* sample 2 */
$this->redirect('controller/action/param1/value1');
$this->redirect('controller/action/?sort_by=code&sort_dir=asc&page=1');
/* sample 3 - short syntax, missing controller means use current controller name */
$this->redirect('index'); 
</pre>
