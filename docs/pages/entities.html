<h3>General Info <a class="hashlink" href="#general">¶</a></h3>

Every Active Record model extends a base class (CModel with all the database logic), which has a lot of overhead and dramatically
slows down your application with thousands and thousands of records.
<br /><br />

Model entities don't extend any class, they are just regular PHP classes with properties and getters and setters.
Generally the properties are protected or private, so they only can be accessed through getters and setters.
<br /><br />

Entities are objects with identity. Their identity has a conceptual meaning inside the model they are related.
In an application each post has a unique ID. You can uniquely identify each post by that ID.
<br /><br />

You may use entities to work with database table records.
<br /><br />

Here an example of how to create entity and save it's data in database.
<pre name="dlhl" class="php">
// Create new entity
$post = new PostEntity();
$post->header = $this->_view->header;
$post->category_id = $this->_view->categoryId;
$post->post_text = $this->_view->postText;
$post->metatag_title = $this->_view->metaTagTitle;
$post->metatag_keywords = $this->_view->metaTagKeywords;
$post->metatag_description = $this->_view->metaTagDescription;

// Manipulation with entity's data here...

// Create model
$posts = Posts::model();

// Create new post
if ($posts->save($post)) {
    $msg = 'Post has been successfully created!';
    $msgType = 'success';
} else {
    $msg = 'An error occurred while creating a post! Please re-enter.';
    $msgType = 'error';
}
</pre>
<br>

<h3>Filling Data <a class="hashlink" href="#general">¶</a></h3>
You may also create entity and fill it with data from model
<pre name="dlhl" class="php">
// Create model
$posts = Posts::model()->findByPk($this->_view->postId);

// Create entity and fill it from the model
$post = new PostEntity($this->_view->postId);
$post->fillFromArray($posts->getFieldsAsArray());

// Show entity
// CDebug::d($post->allowedColumns(),1);

// Manipulation with entity's data here...

// Update the post
if ($posts->save($post)) {
    $msg = 'Post has been successfully updated!';
    $msgType = 'success';
} else {
    $msg = 'An error occurred while updating a post! Please re-enter.';
    $msgType = 'error';
}
</pre>

<a name="fillable_and_guarded"></a>
<h3>Fillable and Guarded fields <a class="hashlink" href="#general">¶</a></h3>
You may specify either a fillable or guarded attribute on the entity, as a protect against mass-assignment by default.
The mass assignment may be a method of causing an array of information which will be saved to the required model directly.
In general, you do not have to save data on your model on one by one basis, however rather in a very single method.
<br><br>
Using entities is one of the best facts in our Framework, but when using a model, it has variables, and one of them is "fillable".
You can define those fields which can be created/ filled by mass-assignment by use of fillable.
<br><br>
Guarded is that the reverse of fillable. If fillable specifies that fields to be mass assigned, guarded specifies that
fields don't seem to be mass assignable.

<pre name="dlhl" class="php">
/** @var - by default all fields are fillable */
protected $_fillable = array();
/** @var - by default no field is guarded */
protected $_guarded = array();
//protected $_guarded = array('post_datetime', 'author_id');
</pre>

You may also set guarded fields "on the fly", when you may use a different fields specified as "guarded" depending
on "insert" or "update" mode.
<pre name="dlhl" class="php">
$post->setGuarded(array('author_id', 'post_datetime'));
</pre>
